This is a static, one page site build with Tailwind CSS. It is used as a placeholder landing page
between conferences.

### Prerequisites

Install the `tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite` Node packages.

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

### Usage

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Deploy

The site is deployed to GitHub Pages. To deploy the site, simply push the changes to the `main` branch.

Note, between conferences, the hostname for the site needs to be updated in GitHub Pages
settings. Changing the previous year's site to 202X.rockymtnruby.dev and pointing rockymtnruby.dev
to this repo's GitHub Pages.
